# Higher or Lower

This is an intermediate project. This game involves answering questions where you must choose which option is higher.

## How it works

This project provides information about two Instagram pages, including their name, description, and nationality. You must choose which one has more followers. If you choose incorrectly, you will lose.

**The whole goal is to score as high as posible.**

## More About this project

This project was built to practice Python in a real-world scenario by creating an intermediate-level game. The main idea for this project came from one of the projects/challenges in my [Python Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/).
